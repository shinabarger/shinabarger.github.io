			<h1>David Shinabarger</h1>
			<h2>MSI Student</h2>
			<h3>UX Research & Design</h3>
			<h4>HCI graduate student at the University of Michigan studying UX research, UX design, and interactive data visualization. Go Blue! 〽️ ​ With five years of industry experience designing websites, conducting UX research, analyzing business and client
				needs, and managing products, I know the importance in creating user-friendly products. I love leaving things better than I found them, and figuring out the "why" behind how products are designed. ​ Outside of work you'll find me bicycling,
				orienteering, reading a good book, cooking, and playing board games.
