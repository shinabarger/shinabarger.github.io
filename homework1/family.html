<h2>In 2017 I did a New Year's Resolution to do "Sunday Funday", where my wife Valerie Shinabarger and I did an outdoor adventure every single Sunday that year.</h2>
<h3>Our first Sunday Funday was approximately 8* fahrenheit and super windy.</h3>Ã“

<h3>And other days were just plain cold, and we were able to hike right on the frozen Huron River</h3>
